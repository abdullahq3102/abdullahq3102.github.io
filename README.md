Acknowledgement: I used chatgpt when adding the loading projects activity. I used these prompts

Prompt 1
I have this html file and I have this activity to modify it to cycle through the projects section

Activity-5: Adding Dynamic Content with JavaScript
1. Update the section “Projects” to include your most recent projects.
2. You should use JavaScript to dynamically display only the latest project in the
section.
3. Add a new <div> element in the HTML for the "Recent Projects" section. Ensure that
this <div> has an ID so that JavaScript can inject the project content into this section.

4. Write a JavaScript function that loops through the array of projects and generates the
HTML content for each project. Use DOM manipulation methods to insert this content
into the "Recent Projects" section of your website.
5. Implement a "Load More" button at the bottom of the "Recent Projects" section that,
when clicked, dynamically loads additional projects from your array using JavaScript.
6. Once the dynamic content is working, commit all your changes and take screenshots
of the repo and the "Recent Projects" section of your deployed website. Add the
screenshots to your readme file.
Here are some useful tutorials to DOM manipulations:
